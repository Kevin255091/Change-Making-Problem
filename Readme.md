# Solving the change making problem

My code for solving the change making problem using C++ and dynamic programming.

## Using the code

### Prerequisites

You need to have g++ or other C++ compiler installed on your computer.

### Compiling the code

Use the command prompt and go to the directory where the file 'change_making.cpp' is.

Type the following command :

```
g++ change_making.cpp -o change_making
```
### Running the test

There is only one line in the test input file 'Input.txt', which consists of n+1 numbers.

The first n numbers are the values of coins, which are in ascending order and the first value should be 1.

The last number is the value to be made up by the previous n coin values.

For Windows system, type
```
change_making < Input.txt
```

For Unix-like system, type
```
./change_making < Input.txt
```
